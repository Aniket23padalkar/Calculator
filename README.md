## Description

This repository contains **three versions of a Calculator** (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced) built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

I started this as my **first JavaScript project**, and instead of just making one calculator, I built it in **three levels** to understand how the logic grows step by step.

I rewrote the code multiple times, experimented, broke things, and fixed them — because my main focus was **learning the flow**, not just finishing it.

## Thought Process

-   At the beginning, I understood the concepts but struggled with syntax.
-   Instead of stopping, I came up with the idea of **building three levels** of the same project so I could understand the logic better.
-   My aim was to **learn, not memorize** — and this project reflects that mindset.
-   I’ll honestly say I haven’t grasped everything 100% yet, but I believe that’s what coding is about: **learning by doing, over time**.

## Final Note

These calculators are not just small projects for me — they represent my determination and curiosity in coding.

In each project folder, you’ll find a **README note** where I’ve explained what I understood at that stage.

I hope my efforts and growth are visible here.
