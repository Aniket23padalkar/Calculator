# Advanced Calculator

-   Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
-   **C (Clear):** reset
-   **=:** calculate
-   **DEL:** delete last entry
-   **History:** view past calculations
-   **Clear history:** wipe all history
-   Keyboard support
-   Responsive UI

## Description

This is my **Advanced Calculator** project.  
In my second project `(ToDo app)` I realized how much local storage changes the logic.  
So I built this project mainly to practice it.

## How It Works

-   Button / key press â†’ update `input`
-   **C:** clear and show `0`
-   **=:** evaluate with `eval()` (inside `try-catch`) and save to local storage
-   **DEL:** remove last character
-   **History / Clear:** load or wipe from local storage

## Challenges

-   Using local storage
-   Highlighting keyboard input
-   Event delegation
